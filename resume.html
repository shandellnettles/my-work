<h2>Objective</h3>

<p>Choosing a professional path has always centered around my creativity and imagination. My primary goal is to become a character creator, bringing original worlds and personalities to life through design, and artistic vision. This career allows me to express the ideas that inspire me most and push my creativity to new levels. At the same time, I recognize the importance of having a flexible backup plan, which is why I’m also pursuing skills in graphic design. Whether I’m illustrating characters or creating visual content, both paths allow my creativity to guide me toward a future where art is at the center of what I do.</p>
